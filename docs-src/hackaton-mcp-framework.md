# Company Hackathon Pitch: MCP Framework

Make AI integrations 10x faster across the company by standardizing on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a production-ready, type-safe framework.

## 1) Executive Summary (60s)
- Problem: Teams spend days/weeks hand-rolling JSON-RPC, transports, validation, and glue code for AI integrations. Results are inconsistent, hard to secure, and hard to reuse.
- Solution: mcp-framework — a provider-based, secure, and fully TypeScripted framework that hides protocol complexity and lets teams implement business logic only.
- Impact: Faster delivery (hours vs. days), consistent quality/security, cross-team reuse, and simpler maintenance.

## 2) Why Now
- AI adoption is accelerating; internal tools need a consistent, secure way to expose capabilities to assistants.
- MCP is becoming the interoperability layer for assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.).
- A standard framework prevents fragmentation and duplicated effort across teams.

## 3) What We’re Building During the Hackathon
- A turnkey MCP server that any team can adopt in minutes.
- Example providers that map to common enterprise needs:
  - DevOps: deploy/rollback, service status, on-call ops
  - Docs: read/annotate knowledge, policy lookup
  - Data: query/report with guardrails
- Polished developer experience: templates, examples, docs, quick start.

## 4) Value Proposition (Benefits)
- Speed: Ship new AI-powered workflows in hours.
- Security: Centralized validation, URI checks, and safer error responses.
- Flexibility: STDIO (local), HTTP/WebSocket (remote) transports.
- Type safety: First-class TypeScript, strong schemas.
- Operability: Health, logging, metrics baked in (extensible).

## 5) What’s Included (MVP Scope)
- Provider pattern (Tools, Resources, Prompts) with abstract base classes
- Transports: stdio (done), HTTP, WebSocket (planned/adding)
- JSON-RPC and MCP capability negotiation
- URI validation and error code standardization
- Resource templates for dynamic resources
- Example providers + tests

## 6) Demo Plan (5–7 minutes)
1. Spin up a sample server with 1–2 providers
2. Show MCP Inspector connecting and invoking a tool
3. Read a dynamic resource using a template URI
4. Switch transport from stdio to HTTP with one config change
5. Wrap with metrics/health endpoints (curl check)

## 7) Architecture (at a glance)
- Framework layer manages: transports, JSON-RPC, provider lifecycle, security, logging
- Business layer implements: ToolProvider, ResourceProvider, PromptProvider
- Storage abstraction with pluggable backends (SQLite → Postgres)

See docs/core-concepts.md for diagrams and deeper context.

## 8) Timeline & Milestones
- Day 1 (AM): Finalize transports (HTTP/WS), polish provider scaffolds
- Day 1 (PM): Example providers + integration tests; docs pass
- Day 2 (AM): Demo plumbing, metrics/health polish; Confluence publishing
- Day 2 (PM): Dry run, feedback, final demo

## 9) Success Criteria (Judging Alignment)
- Working demo with 2+ realistic providers
- Swap transports without code changes (config only)
- Clear docs: 5‑minute quick start, examples, Confluence page
- Tests pass; basic security checks enforced (URI, size limits)

## 10) Team & Roles
- Lead/Coordinator: Owner of timeline and scope
- Provider Devs: Implement 1 provider each (DevOps, Docs, Data)
- Platform Dev: Transports, server wiring, health/metrics
- Docs/DevRel: Quick start, examples, Confluence, demo script

## 11) Risks & Mitigations
- Scope creep → lock to MVP; backlog stretch goals
- Security gaps → default validators, minimal surface area, safe errors
- Adoption friction → templates, examples, copy-paste starter

## 12) Getting Started (Quick Start)
```bash
# install deps
npm install

# build & run sample (stdio)
npm run build
node dist/server.js

# (optional) HTTP mode via env/config
# MCP_TRANSPORT_MODE=http MCP_HTTP_PORT=3000 node dist/server.js

# test suite
npm test
```

## 13) Call to Action
- Pilot this framework for one workflow per team this quarter.
- Contribute a provider (even a simple one) to build the internal catalog.
- Share feedback in Confluence/Discussions for the next iteration.
